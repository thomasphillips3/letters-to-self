# Letters to My Future Self
** Letters To My Future Self - A Styling Project **

I bought [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Letters-My-Future-Self-Treasure/dp/1452125376), and want to recreate it digitally using practice using CSS.

At once a priceless memento and a journey forward in time, this innovative book of 12 fold-and-mail style letters offers a unique way to capture the moment. Each letter bears a prompt to inspire self-reflection. Once written, the letters can be sealed with the stickers included and postdated. The keepsake bundle of letters is like a dozen diary entries for the future. A thoughtful present for anyone embarking on a new stage in their life's journey, Letters to My Future Self offers both the gift of looking forward and the delight of remembering times past.
